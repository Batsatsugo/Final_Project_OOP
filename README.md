# Final_Project_OOP
# ATM Banking System (Banko De Cora)

Banko De Cora is a simple graphical ATM banking system developed in Python using the `tkinter` module for GUI and `datetime` for timestamping transactions. 
This project simulates basic ATM functionalities in a desktop application setting, making it ideal for beginner programmers or students exploring Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and GUI design in Python.

With this system, users can:
- Log in securely using a personal PIN
- View current balance
- Make withdrawals and deposits
- Change their PIN
- Receive a transaction receipt with date and time

The program mimics the look and logic of a real ATM interface and demonstrates good programming practices like data encapsulation, input validation, and GUI event handling.

## Instructions on how to install

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system (preferably version 3.7 or later).
2. Clone this repository or download the source code manually as a ZIP file and extract it.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder containing the Python file.
4. Run the application with the following command:
   ```bash
   python atm_app.py

üìù No additional packages are needed except for Python's built-in `tkinter` and `datetime` modules.

Once the application starts:

You‚Äôll be prompted to enter your PIN.

Upon successful login, you‚Äôll be directed to a menu to perform transactions.

Each action updates the account and shows a confirmation, including a detailed transaction receipt.

## Credits to the owner
This project was developed with the help and guidance of my friend. Parts of the code were adapted and used as a reference for learning purposes. Huge thanks to them for allowing me to learn from and build upon their work.
